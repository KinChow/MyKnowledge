## 概念

*A* ***\*circular doubly linked list\**** *is defined as a* [circular linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/circular-linked-list/) *in which each node has two links connecting it to the previous node and the next node.*



- ***\*Circular\****: A circular doubly linked list’s main feature is that it is circular in design.
- ***\*Doubly Linked\****: Each node in a circular doubly linked list has two pointers – one pointing to the node before it and the other pointing to the node after it.
- ***\*Header Node\****: At the start of circular doubly linked lists, a header node or sentinel node is frequently used. This node is used to make the execution of certain operations on the list simpler even though it is not a component of the list’s actual contents.

## 应用

- ***\*Implementation of Circular Data Structures:\**** Circular doubly linked lists are extremely helpful in the construction of circular data structures like circular queues and circular buffers, which are both circular in nature.
- ***\*Implementing Undo-Redo Operations\****: Text editors and other software programs can use circular doubly linked lists to implement undo-redo operations.
- ***\*Music Player Playlist\****: Playlists in music players are frequently implemented using circular doubly linked lists. Each song is kept as a node in the list in this scenario, and the list can be circled to play the songs in the order they are listed.
- ***\*Cache Memory Management\****: To maintain track of the most recently used cache blocks, circular doubly linked lists are employed in cache memory management.
